# Reset Style Sheet Highlighter

Source of the revealing [**Chrome extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reset-style-sheet-highlig/lnekfhlkfibaamhifbfmcobiglhcbmbl) which indicates use of common reset style sheets, like [Yahoo’s Reset CSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20170104054347/https://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/), [Eric Meyer’s Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), [Tantek Çelik’s undohtml.css](http://tantek.com/log/2004/09.html#d06t2354), Nicolas Gallagher’s and Jonathan Neal’s [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), and [Rich Clark’s html5resetcss](https://code.google.com/archive/p/html5resetcss/). ([Why reset style sheets are problematic.](https://meiert.com/en/blog/reasons-against-resets/))

[**Test page**](https://hell.meiert.org/core/html/reset.aux.html) to try the extension (should display “Reset style sheet: reset.css” at the top).
